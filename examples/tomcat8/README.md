# Tomcat8 Web Server

This shows how to launch a *Tomcat8* servlet container with the help of *Bootils*.
It should run unmodified on any recent Debian-like Linux,
and on any other system with a few modifications.
It expects that the
[opt-tomcat8](https://github.com/jhermann/priscilla/tree/master/tomcat8)
package is installed.
