"""
    Bootils offers process boot-strapping utilities that support writing
    robust application/service launcher and process life-cycle management scripts.

    It is comprised of a ``bootils`` Python package with building blocks
    for process and resource management, and a CLI tool named ``nanny`` that
    watches your child process after starting, until it grows up
    into a stable running state.
