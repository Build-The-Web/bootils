Quick-Start Guide
=================

The following will help you setting up and starting a very basic service.
The :doc:`cfg` provides details on the configuration options presented here.

Refer to the
`examples directory on GitHub <https://github.com/Build-The-Web/bootils/tree/master/examples>`_
for more setups of typical services.


A Very Simple Example
---------------------

The ``netcat`` example demonstrates the basic mechanics
of setting up a runtime environment using Bootils,
without any complexity whatsoever introduced by the service that is launched.

The detailed installation steps to run it are found in the `examples/netcat README`_,
here we'll explain the moving parts in that demo and what's their purpose.
