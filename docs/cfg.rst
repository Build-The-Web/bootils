Main Configuration Files
------------------------

Configuration files are expected at the locations as shown by the ``nanny help``
command, on a Linux system that is ``/etc/nanny.conf`` and ``~/.config/nanny.conf``.

They consist of sections that start with a ``[section-name]`` line, with
an (unnamed) *global* section before the named ones.
See `ConfigObj Files`_ for more details.
